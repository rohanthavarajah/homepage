## Projects

### Social Security Sustainability

Solved the numerical scheme of a hyperbolic PDE to get granular estimates of population by age group and assess the relative impact of policies targeting tax rate vs retirement age.

### Labor Market Mismatch

Modeled career pathways with a Hidden Markov Model and used EM to determine the emission and transition matrices characterizing the US labor market.
